However, I wanted to highlight a few points from the meeting that need attention: We discussed launching the campaign in phases, with the first phase targeting email marketing. There were concerns about the current analytics tools not being sufficient for tracking the campaign\u2019s success. Sarah pointed out that the creative team has a tight schedule, and the graphic design assets might be delayed. Key Decisions: We will proceed with a phased launch of the campaign, starting with email marketing. We\u2019ll reassess the analytics tools to ensure they align with our needs for tracking and reporting. Concerns: The timeline for the creative team\u2019s deliverables could delay the campaign. The analytics tools may not be suitable for real-time tracking. Next Steps: Meet with the creative team to clarify the timeline for graphic design assets. Research alternative analytics tools or make upgrades to existing ones. Set up a follow-up meeting next week to review progress on these action items.",
