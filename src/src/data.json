    "summary": "Key Points:\n1. The objective is to automate the requirement gathering, documentation, and validation process in financial institutions using LLM-powered agents. This will ingest and interpret unstructured data (e.g. meetings, emails, PDFs), generate formal requirements/user stories, ensure compliance, and integrate outputs into enterprise tools such as Jira.\n2. The tech stack involved includes Input Layer for text extraction, several agents performing tasks including filtering content, extracting context, generating requirements, compliance check, output routing and transformation logging. \n3. It utilizes tools and APIs such as OpenAI GPT-4 / Anthropic Claude, Jira API, and email integrations.\n4. Secure deployment is assured through Personal Identifiable Information (PII) redaction, storage of audit logs in append-only database, and a role-based validation loop.\n5. Benefits include acceleration in requirement capturing, consistent formatting, compliance, maintenance of traceability and audit readiness, and 70%+ reduction in manual SME effort.\n6. Goals for the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) include auto-generating 3 user stories with acceptance criteria from uploaded PDFs/email transcripts and pushing them to Jira.\n\nActions:\n1. Implement the different components mentioned in the technical blueprint that include Input Layer, multiple agents, memory and reasoning components, Tools & APIs, and the Orchestration Framework.\n2. Work on the MVP goals, this includes the functionality to upload a PDF/email transcript, and auto-generate 3 user stories + acceptance criteria which can be pushed to Jira.\n3. Implement secure measures for deployment including PII redaction and anonymization, audit logs storage, and SME validation loop.\n\nBlockers:\nNo blockers have been mentioned in the document. However, potential challenges could involve ensuring data security and compliance when dealing with sensitive financial information and integration issues with enterprise tools.",
    "requirements": "Business Requirements:\n\n1. As a system engineer, I want to implement an Input Layer that ingests and interprets unstructured data sources (such as meetings, emails, PDFs), so that the system can begin to process requirement generation.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The system should be able to accept various forms of unstructured data and extract the relevant text.\n   - Roles: System Engineer\n   - Expected Behavior: The system should handle various data formats and successfully extract text without data loss.\n\n2. As a software developer, I want to program multiple LLM-powered agents capable of filtering content, extracting context, generating requirements, checking compliance, routing outputs and logging transformations, so that the entire requirements generation process is automated.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: Each agent should perform its designed task effectively and in coordination with other agents.\n   - Roles: Software Developer\n   - Expected Behavior: Agents should work seamlessly with each other to deliver accurate results in a timely manner.\n\n3. As an API integrator, I want to create integrations with OpenAI GPT-4 / Anthropic Claude, Jira API, and email platforms, so that our system can utilize these tools for requirement generation and management.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The system should communicate accurately with the external APIs without any data leakage or security threats.\n   - Roles: API Integrator\n   - Expected Behavior: Smooth and secure data exchange between our system and the external tools.\n\n4. As a compliance officer, I want to ensure PII redaction, secure audit log storage, and role-based validation is implemented, so that the system is secure and compliant.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The system must meet all security and compliance standards mandated for financial institutions.\n   - Roles: Compliance Officer\n   - Expected Behavior: The system should consistently redact sensitive information, store logs securely and follow a role-based validation process.\n\n5. As a product manager, I want the MVP to auto-generate 3 user stories with acceptance criteria from uploaded files (PDFs, email transcripts), and push these to Jira, so that the product offers a significant reduction in manual effort associated with requirements gathering.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The MVP must successfully create user stories and push them to Jira without manual intervention.\n   - Roles: Product Manager\n   - Expected Behavior: The MVP should operate efficiently, accurately creating user stories and pushing them to Jira.",
