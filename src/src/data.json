Background\nThe current loan application process at XYZ Bank is manual, paper-based, and requires customers to visit branches physically. This has led to increased turnaround time (TAT), frequent errors, and poor customer experience. The management wants to digitize the entire loan origination process for personal loans.\n\n## 2. As-is Process\nThe as-is process steps are documented below (as-is process diagram):\n<<Image>>\n\n## 3. Business Requirements\n### 3.1 Functional Requirements\n- Online loan application form with Aadhaar/PAN-based pre-fill.\n- Integration with credit bureau (CIBIL) to fetch credit score.\n- AI-based eligibility and risk assessment module.\n- Real-time KYC document verification (OCR + face match).\n- Loan sanction and e-agreement signing via OTP-based authentication.\n- Integration with core banking for disbursement.\n\n### 3.2 System Orchestration Requirements\n- File Storage: To be defined\n- Output File Library: To be defined\n\n### 3.3 UI/UX Requirements\n- Login Screen: Users are expected to log in using Single Sign-On (SSO) when accessing. This login mechanism enhances security and streamlines the authentication process.\n- User Role-Based Access:\n  - Manager Role: Managers should be granted access to cases, empowering them to utilize both the upload and download functionalities of the automation. This role ensures that managerial users have the necessary permissions for case-related activities.\n  - Admin Role: Admin access, reserved for select team members, provides comprehensive access to the entire application. This privileged role is designated for individuals who require full control and oversight of the application's functionalities.\n\n### 3.4 Non-Functional Requirements\n- Audit Trail: A comprehensive audit trail will be maintained to track user activities within the application. This includes capturing user-specific information such as usernames, date and time stamps, and the type of activities performed.\n- Monitoring and Reporting: The system will collect log data to monitor the number of active users and track individual usernames. Additionally, performance metrics of the application will be recorded.\n- Security: User authentication will be implemented using secure protocols. This security measure ensures that only authenticated users with proper credentials can access the system, enhancing overall system security.\n- Reliability: The system is committed to maintaining a minimum uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance.\n\n## 4. To Be Process\nAnticipated Procedural Steps for MVP-1:\n- The Team initializes the application login procedure upon receipt of emails.\n- Subsequently, the team systematically transfers files, utilizing them as inputs for the designated tool.\n\n## 5. Assumptions\n- Customer must have Aadhaar-linked mobile number\n- System must support English and Hindi\n- Loan disbursement only through verified bank accounts\n\n## 6.
